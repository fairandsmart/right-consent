## Jekyll

Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes text written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on the page, and more.

### Prerequisites

Jekyll requires the following:

- Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher
- RubyGems
- GCC and Make

### Instructions 

1. Install all prerequisites.
2. Install the jekyll and bundler gems.
```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

3. Build the site and make it available on a local server.
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Browse to http://localhost:4000

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

We use Docusaurus to build the technical and API documentations pages.

Docusaurus requires the following:

- Node version >= 16.0.0
- npm
