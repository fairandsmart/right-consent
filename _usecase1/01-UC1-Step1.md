On my website, I use web forms to **collect personal information** about my customers or prospects in order to offer better services and to strengthen relationships.

That customer information is collected directly in my CRM tools for marketing contact purposes but I do not like the integrated **GDPR** checkbox which is very restrictive in terms of user experience and  user trust.

I would also like to **improve the service** with more processing activities that require user consent but without creating frustration for my customers.
