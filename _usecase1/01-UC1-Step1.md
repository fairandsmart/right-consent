On my website I use web forms to collect some personal information about my customers in order to propose 
a better service and relationship.  
That customer information are collected directly in my CRM tools for the marketing contact
purpose but I don't like the embedded RGPD checkbox which is very restrictive in terms of 
user experience and user confidence. 
I also would like to increase the service with more processing that requires user consent but without
creating frustration for my customers.
