A specific form is then generated according to a specified Consent Context for a dedicated subject.  

The form is aware of user pasts choices and, for exemple, can be hidden in case of already consented elements.   

Consent & Preferences collect forms are easy to embed using pre-rendered HTML Form in an IFrame or using the API directly.
