A specific form is then generated according to a **Consent Context** specified for a dedicated subject.

The form is aware of the user's previous choices and, for example, can be hidden in case of elements already consented.

Consent and preference collection forms are easy to embed using a **pre-rendered HTML form** in an IFrame or using the API directly.
