At the end of the process, a Consent Receipt is generated and stored for proof and exchange.  

Receipt can embed attachments to reinforce proof like the displayed form or a validation proof (SMS code, electronic signature).

It allows counterparts to keep a trace of consent but also embed a QRCode that can be used by the owner to change its choices at any time during the validity of the consent.
