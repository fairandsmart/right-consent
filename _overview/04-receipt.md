At the end of the process, a **Consent Receipt** is generated and stored for **proof** and **exchange**.

The receipt may include **attachments** to reinforce the proof such as the form displayed or proof of **validation** (SMS code, electronic signature).

It allows counterparties to **keep track** of the consent but also to embed a QR Code that can be used by the owner to **modify its choices** at any time during the validity of the consent.
