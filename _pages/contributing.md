As Right Consents Community is a **free and Open Source** software you can **contribute** to its development by reporting bugs and/or pull requests in github.

## Follow basic contribution rules

If you are not familiar with open source project contribution, feel free to visit [Github guide firstcontribution](https://firstcontributions.github.io/) which is a good start.

## Bug Report & new features

If you've found a bug, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/fairandsmart/right-consents/issues) to report it.

You can also ask for new features on the discussions page but you should be aware that we are proposing an enterprise version of Right Consents that could already provide requested feature.
