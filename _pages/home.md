## **Notable features**

### Administration interface for all stakeholders
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-1.png)
**A full featured backoffice** allows multiple stakeholders to create forms for all kinds of situations which require the end-user approval (processings, preferences, terms of service) and access history of those records.

### Self-service interface end-users
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-7.png)
All end-users can access their own **Preference Center** : a user dedicated page that allows them to update their consents and preferences when they want. It can be made accessible in multiple ways including through a dedicated link.

### Configurable and granular consent structures
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-6.png)
**Customised templates** with generic information (privacy policy, PII controller, …) can be used in various collecting schemes including a **specific operator interface** that allows to setup a user preferences and consents on his behalf (call-centers, physical stores, parents for children…) with further confirmation through email. Fits to all use cases and all channels.

### Strong proof of validity
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-3.png)
Right Consents platform **ensure records** of consents, preferences or Terms of services and generates **receipts** in order to build a fully operational consents base and a **long term preservation** receipts base compliant with GDPR recommendations.

### High interoperability
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-4.png)
Consent receipts are available in multiple formats (xml, pdf, html). Those receipts allow all stakeholders (Data Subjects, Data Controllers, Data Processors, Data Protection Authorities…) to keep track of a given consent but also to forward or transfer that consent to any involved third-party.

### Easy to use
![backoffice](/right-consents/assets/images/screen-2.png)
Create your own processing activities library and drag and drop them into as many collecting forms as you want to. This processing-based approach allows you to easily query the consent records database, no matter how far you went into customizing the collection forms.

### Easy to integrate
