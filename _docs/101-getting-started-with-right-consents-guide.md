Learn how to start using Right Consents **backoffice** and **API** to define, collect and query consents using the API via curl

- Understand the different **stages** of consent collect in Right Consents
- Discover the backoffice and define some **consent model elements**
- Use the backoffice assembly tool to try different **consent form layout** until desired result
- Understand **API basic concepts** and ressources
- Use **curl** to make basic API calls for consent collection simple scenario

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide you need :

- Roughly 45 minutes
- Git
- Docker
- Right Consents running
- Curl

## Overview

In this guide you will discover the different stages that are covered by Right Consents in consent management : the definition of consent library elements, the design of different consent collect forms and the integration into existing applications or web sites.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/gettingstarted-overview.jpg" alt="Getting Started with Right Consents - Overview" %}

This guide also covers some basic aspects of the API and some basic calls that can to be done by any external application.

## The different stages of consent collection

Consent collection is a more or less complex operation in the fact that it is either a legal part of a data processing but also a software piece that captures user choice at a specific time and holds that data for a relative long time in a standard way. The information generated by that software piece often need to be accessed or disseminated to third part software as user choices could have an impact on many pieces of an information system.

### Stage One : define

The **first stage** is mainly handled by the data controller itself or the data protection officer (dpo) and is mainly an **administrative task**.

That stage aims to **define** all the elements that takes part in the consent collection. Those elements are purely declarative but have a specific structure and will be stored with the consent itself for a long time.

Right Consents helps to **define, manage and preserve** processings declaration but also of other informations like terms of service, preferences, legal information. Like a CMS, Right Consents will handle consent elements **lifecycle** to ensure the **legal validity** by assuming **auditing** and **versionning** but also by generating some **digital proofs** of any produced content.

Then, elements will be accessible throught the API for next stage or for other dissemination goals (processing registry).

### Stage two : design

The **second stage** is to assemble declared elements into specific layout that fits with the final integration goal.

For exemple, Terms of Service will be collected at startup of an application or at signup whereas some processing consent could be collected only when a specific service is requested. Some processings could be collected in the website where some other in a mobile application only.

Right Consents defines the notion of **Consent Context** that will holds all aspects of an application's pointcut that handles user consent need. Right Consents **backoffice** propose a **graphical tool** to design Consent Context.

At the end you can extract the generated JSON configuration for **integration** in any **external application**.

### Stage three : integrate

The **third stage** is handled by a **developer** and consist in using predefined Consent Context base configuration for integration into the target application.

As Consent Context contains also specific runtime information like the subject id, integration needs to be dynamic according to the target context. The Consent Context will then be pushed to the API to declare a new **Consent Transaction** that will act as a consent collection workflow.

The Consent Transaction will be aslo an **unique entry point** that will live during all the consent preservation time, allowing users to retrieve information about consent maybe years after. Integration may also require to query end user choices at some points of an user experience.

Once the transaction is committed, specific pieces of informations are generated : some **Consent Records** and a **Consent Receipt**.


## Define consent collect elements

### Create the information element

Go to the bacokffice application : http://localhost:4286 (login using user/pass: demo@demo.com/demo42) and **create an information model** by going into the dedicated section : Menu > Configuration > Information  
Choose a relevant name and description for that model (only for internal management):  
- Name: Legal information
- Description : My legal information description

Then you can **populate** the model **data content**. One single model can have multiple version of data content :
- Title: Legal Information
- Header Content : The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated entities (“The Cheesecake Factory,” “the Company,” “we”, “us” or “our”) respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting it through our compliance with our privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).
- Footer Content: Thanks for your confidence
- Data controller
  - Company: The CheeseCake Factory
  - Address: 26901 Malibu Hills Road, Calabasas Hills, CA 91301
  - Email: privacyofficer@thecheesecakefactory.com
  - Phone Number: 18664582951
- Privacy Policy URL: https://www.thecheesecakefactory.com/corporate-information/privacy-policy

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> For specific documentation about Information Content please refere to the dedicated guide: {% link _docs/200-consent-elements-doc.md %}
{: .notice--info}

Now you are ready for **publishing** that version of the information model by clicking on **'Save Draft'** button and then on the **'Activate'** button.

By activating the version you will be able to use it for collecting consent. As soon as a consent is collected using that version of the information model, you will no longer be able to delete it.

Information about model lifecycle is visible in the top of the right panel. You may notice that version 1.0 is active and that a unique serial number has been allocated to that particular version.

If you perform modification on that model you will have to activate the next version and a popup will ask you for a **Major** or **Minor** release evolution. A Major one will result in considering already collected consent with that information to be stalled whereas a Minor one will be compatible with already collected consent but will replace previous one in the next generated consent transaction.

### Create one processing element

All model types are following the same lifecycle management and only the model data content is changing. Then we need also to create a model for processing description.

Go to bacokffice application : http://localhost:4286 (login using user/pass: demo@demo.com/demo42) and create a processing model by going into the dedicated section : Menu > Configuration > Processing  
Choose a relevant name and description for the processing :
- Name: Marketing Communications
- Description: My Marketting Communications

Then you can populate the data content:
- Title: Contact Marketing
- Processed data: Your contact information (name, surname, email and phone number)
- Purpose: We will contact you according to your favorite channel (email, sms or phonecall) to propose discount regarding new products arrival.
- Data retention period: We are keeping your contact information during 2 years

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> For specific documentation about Information Content please refere to the dedicated guide:  {% link _docs/200-consent-elements-doc.md %}
{: .notice--info}

Now you are ready for publishing that version of the information model by clicking on 'Save Draft' button and then on the 'Activate' button.

## Design a collection form

### Use the backoffice to assemble defined elements

Go to bacokffice application : http://localhost:4286 (login using user/pass: demo@demo.com/demo42) and create a consent form design by going into the dedicated section : Menu > Integration > Collect  

The created elements are visible in the right panel and can be drag'n drop in the central design zone to assemble elements in the desired order.

By clicking on 'Next' you will access to the layout design of the choosen elements like a vertical or horizontal layout but also you can specify labels and some action availability. It is also possible to specify a "Theme" element that will apply a specific look'n feel if desired.

The 'Next' step will give you access to Consent Context data allowing you to test your layout for a particular end user (a test one).
- CustomerId: testuser
- Validity: 6 Months
- Confirmation Method: None

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> For specific documentation about Content Context please refere to the dedicated guide: {% link _docs/201-consent-context-doc.md %}
{: .notice--info}

Now you can click on the 'Get API Call Url' to test an HTML version of the form for the provided enduser and follow the consent collect workflow according to the configured design.

### Export the generated context

By clicking on the 'Get API Call Url' you have generate a Consent Transaction that holds all designed information for the specified enduser. A full JSON representation of all the configured elements and context has been provided to the API and stored in a unique transaction accessible with its id. A token has also be generated allowing to send the generated URL by email for exemple.

This operation can also be done by calling the API providing a specific consent collect JSON. If you are admin or operator you can create transactions for another endusers but as a simple user, you can ony generate transaction for yourself.

The generated context JSON can then serve as a basis for integration in existing target applications. Some parts of that context could be made variables depending on the integration needs. Here is a minimal version of a context:

{% highlight json %}
{
  "subject":"testuser",
  "layoutData":{
    "type":"layout",
    "elements":["processing.001"],
    "orientation":"VERTICAL",
    "info":"information.001"
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Integrate a simple consent collect scenario with curl

According to the modelised elements and the predefined consent collect transaction skeleton we can perform direct API calls.

### Authenticate test user

Use the testuser credentials in curl over the Identity Provider to retrieve an access token allowing authenticated calls on the API:

{% highlight bash %}
RESPONSE=`curl -v -d "client_id=cmclient" \
                  -d "username=usertest" \
                  -d "password=test" \
                  -d "grant_type=password" \
                  http://localhost:4285/auth/realms/RightConsents/protocol/openid-connect/token`
ACCESS_TOKEN=`echo ${RESPONSE} | jq -r '.access_token'`
REFRESH_TOKEN=`echo ${RESPONSE} | jq -r '.refresh_token'`
{% endhighlight %}

The refresh token can be used later avoiding reusing password:

{% highlight bash %}
RESPONSE=`curl -v -d "client_id=cmclient" \
                  -d "refresh_token=${REFRESH_TOKEN}" \
                  -d "grant_type=refresh_token" \
                  http://localhost:4285/auth/realms/RightConsents/protocol/openid-connect/token`
ACCESS_TOKEN=`echo ${RESPONSE} | jq -r '.access_token'`
REFRESH_TOKEN=`echo ${RESPONSE} | jq -r '.refresh_token'`
{% endhighlight %}

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> You can also create new user directly from the login screen of the GUI http://localhost:4286 or via the IdP admin console available at http://localhost:4285/auth/admin (admin/admin)
{: .notice--info}

The access token have a short time validity and yo umay have to renew it during the guide, just replay those requests when needed.

### Create a consent transaction

Using the generated context, call the API to start a consent transaction:

{% highlight bash %}
TXID=`curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
              --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
              --request POST \
              --data '{"subject":"usertest","layoutData":{"type":"layout","elements":["processing.001"],"orientation":"VERTICAL","info":"information.001"}}' \
              http://localhost:4287/consents`
echo ${TXID}
{% endhighlight %}

The result is a transaction creation attached to a unique ID that will be used to access transaction. The response contains the transacton ID in its body but also a complete link to the created transaction inthea Location header.

<i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> If you don't want to use the same IdP for your users than for the consent API, you'll have to insert a kind of Proxy (server side) to ensure Consent API authentication process (as admin or operator) and generates transactions for the enduser without its own authentication. More informations about authentication solutions are describes in the {% link _docs/104-authentication-guide.md %}
{: .notice--info}


### Get the transaction

Transaction API supports 2 mimetypes : html or json. In HTML, client is supposed to be a browser and getting the transaction resource will send a redirection to the next human action needed for that transaction (submit consent, confirm consent, show receipt, restart a new transaction).

{% highlight bash %}
TX_HTML=`curl -v --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
                 --header "Accept: text/html" \
                 http://localhost:4287/consents/${TXID}`
echo ${TX_HTML}
{% endhighlight %}

In JSON, only a representation of the transaction is send including the link to the next action.

{% highlight bash %}
TX_JSON=`curl -v --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
                 --header "Accept: application/json" \
                 http://localhost:4287/consents/${TXID}`
echo ${TX_JSON}
FORM_URL=`echo ${TX_JSON} | jq -r '.task'`
echo ${FORM_URL}
{% endhighlight %}

In both case, an authentication token is included avoiding to use the OIDC Bearer token for the transaction process, making it easyer to integrate in a popup or an IFrame. The token can be joined to all action as a query param (/submit?t=$token).

A short version of the transaction just after creation is:

{% highlight json %}
{
   "id":"P6f1JU6LjKoUwR5QBEYPgf",
   "subject":"usertest",
   "state":"CREATED",
   "token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJQNmYxSlU2TGpLb1V3UjVRQkVZUGdmIiwiZXhwIjoxNjYwOTMwMzMyfQ.0pGomVcjvGGWshhovRpCKjP6BVOt2K6-W6QXLCVlwsA",
   "task":"http://localhost:4287/consents/P6f1JU6LjKoUwR5QBEYPgf/submit",
   "breed":"http://localhost:4287/consents/P6f1JU6LjKoUwR5QBEYPgf/child"
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Get consent form and submit values

When the transaction is in the state CREATED, the next step is submission of consent, calling the url of the task field will produce the form needed for consent submission.

{% highlight bash %}
FORM_JSON=`curl -v --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
                   --header "Accept: application/json" \
                   ${FORM_URL}`
echo ${FORM_JSON}
{% endhighlight %}

Many informations are included in the JSON representation of the form mainly for disaplying legal information to the enduser. The Html version is fully operationnal without any interpretation. Important parts are the serial numebrs of elements. Only few informations need to be submitted or consent:

{% highlight bash %}
FORM_INFO_KEY=`echo ${FORM_JSON} | jq -r '.info.entry.key'`
FORM_INFO_SERIAL=`echo ${FORM_JSON} | jq -r '.info.serial'`
FORM_PROC_KEY=`echo ${FORM_JSON} | jq -r '.elements[0].entry.key'`
FORM_PROC_SERIAL=`echo ${FORM_JSON} | jq -r '.elements[0].serial'`
FORM_VALUES="\"{'info':['element/information/${FORM_INFO_KEY}/${FORM_INFO_SERIAL}'],'element/processing/${FORM_PROC_KEY}/${FORM_PROC_SERIAL}':['accepted']}\""
SUBMIT_JSON=`curl -v --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
                     --header "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
                     --header "Accept: application/json" \
                     --request POST \
                     --data ${FORM_VALUES} \
                     ${FORM_URL}`
{% endhighlight %}
