## What is an operator?

Operators have restricted access to the Right Consents Community backoffice. Their main role is to **manage users consents**, for instance as phone operators, but they cannot create or edit models or manage API keys.

They can **search for a user ID** via the search bar at the top of the backoffice: if the user ID is known, the operator is redirected to the **dedicated operator interface** of this user, otherwise they are offered to create a new user based on the chosen ID.

## Operate consents

Each time a change is made by the operator on a user's **operator interface**, it is logged into the **modification panel** on the right, pending for the operator's validation. As long as the modifications are not confirmed by the operator, it does not change anything for the end-user.

Once every change needed is made, the operator can confirm their changes and add additional information such as a general comment and choosing to **email the end-user** with the new receipt for the changes made. All records and receipts created this way are **marked as generated by an operator on the user's behalf**, for more transparency and traceability.

See more about the operator interface [here](/docs/user-queries).
