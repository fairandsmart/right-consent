The [form editor](/docs/consent-context) provides a sandbox for you to preview your form before integrating them to your website.

The **Elements** section allows you to assemble your **processings and preferences** in the desired order or to select your **terms and conditions**. The **information** model will be automatically selected as Right Consents Community only allows creating one.

In the **Preview** section, you can choose an [orientation](/docs/themes), whether the footer should be sticky (always visible) and select a **theme**.

The **Options** section is out of scope here since its changes have no impact on the form preview, but you can use mock **subject IDs** to test the whole process in real conditions with the **"Get API call URL"** button.

Once you are happy with the result, you will need to translate it into a JSON [consent context](/docs/consent-context) and [integrate](/docs/integration) it in your website, application or anywhere you'd like.
