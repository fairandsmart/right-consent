# Receipts



## Definition

Receipts are **files** created each time a [**subject**](/docs/concepts/subjects) submits their consent and choices about a given [**context**](/docs/concepts/transactions).
They are stored in the easy-to-process **XML** format, but can also be generated in a more human-readable format (namely **PDF**).

They can act as **proof of consent** as they hold all the necessary information:
- the subject identifier
- the language used
- the collection method
- the collection and expiration time
- the receipt identifier
- the exact content of each element (processing, preferences, terms & conditions) which was shown to the subject
- the subject's choice about each element
- the name of the data controller
- a link to the privacy policy
- a QR code allowing the subject to change their choices (if possible)



## Access

If you wish so, you can configure your contexts so that subjects will receive a **PDF receipt by email** upon consent submission.
They can then freely dispose of these proofs.

All receipts are also accessible via the **operator backoffice** and, of course, through the **API**.
