This guide also covers how that process is defined in Right Consents and specially the **Consent Transaction** concept and lifecycle.

## Consent Collection

Consent collection is a more or less complex operation in the fact that it has multiple facets :
  - It is a **legal part** of a **data processing**,
  - It is a **software piece** that captures enduser choices at a specific time,
  - It is an **audit system** that holds user choices for a relative long time in a standard way,

According to that facets, the global process of collecting consent is

The information generated by that software piece often need to be accessed or **disseminated to third part software** as user consents could have an impact on many pieces of an information system.

We have identify three stage in the consent collection : defining consent elements, designing consent form and integrating forms into existing applications or websites.

In order to ease the consent collection management, Right Consents defines all pieces of content collecting that takes part in that process like consent **model elements**, consent form layout, consent context, consent transaction, consent record and consent receipt.


### Stage One : define

The **first stage** is mainly handled by the data controller itself or the data protection officer (dpo) and is mainly an **administrative task**.

That stage aims to **define** all the elements that takes part in the consent collection. Those elements are purely declarative but have a specific structure and will be stored with the consent itself for a long time.

Right Consents helps to **define, manage and preserve** processings declaration but also of other informations like terms of service, preferences, legal information. Like a CMS, Right Consents will handle consent elements **lifecycle** to ensure the **legal validity** by assuming **auditing** and **versionning** but also by generating some **digital proofs** of any produced content.

Then, elements will be accessible throught the API for next stage or for other dissemination goals (processing registry).

### Stage two : design

The **second stage** is to assemble declared elements into specific layout that fits with the final integration goal.

For exemple, Terms of Service will be collected at startup of an application or at signup whereas some processing consent could be collected only when a specific service is requested. Some processings could be collected in the website where some other in a mobile application only.

Right Consents defines the notion of **Consent Context** that will holds all aspects of an application's pointcut that handles user consent need. Right Consents **backoffice** propose a **graphical tool** to design Consent Context.

At the end you can extract the generated JSON configuration for **integration** in any **external application**.

### Stage three : integrate

The **third stage** is handled by a **developer** and consist in using predefined Consent Context base configuration for integration into the target application.

As Consent Context contains also specific runtime information like the subject id, integration needs to be dynamic according to the target context. The Consent Context will then be pushed to the API to declare a new **Consent Transaction** that will act as a consent collection workflow.

The Consent Transaction will be aslo an **unique entry point** that will live during all the consent preservation time, allowing users to retrieve information about consent maybe years after. Integration may also require to query end user choices at some points of an user experience.

Once the transaction is committed, specific pieces of informations are generated : some **Consent Records** and a **Consent Receipt**.
