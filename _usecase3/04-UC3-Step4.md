The Right Consents API allows you to register webhooks to receive push notification of any changes from any channel regarding your customers' consents and preferences. All your marketing tools and any other information system elements will then be synchronised with your customer choices, avoiding any communication error.

The API also offers an efficient export function to disseminate customers' choices. It then becomes an effective alternative to avoid costly developments or customization of the elements of the existing information system.
