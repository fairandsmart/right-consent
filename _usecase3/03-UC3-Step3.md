Using Right Consents I can collect only needed elements of user preferences and consent in each of my digital channels. The collect is made with  
a unified graphical approach leaving my customer to progressively reinforce confidence with my usage of their personal information by knowing how to change their mind.  
With the specific consent communication feedback emails, my customers are always informed of their choices. They also have access 
to the dedicated Privacy Center application to manage all their channel choices in a centralized way and to keep a trace of their choice's history.
