By using Right Consents, I can collect necessary elements only of user preferences and consents on each of my digital channels. The collection is done with a unified graphical approach, allowing my clients to gradually build trust in the use of their personal information by knowing how to change their mind.

With specific consent communication feedback emails, my customers are always informed of their choices. They also have access to the dedicated Privacy Center app to centrally manage all their channel choices and keep track of their choice history.
