On each of my channel I have specific processing around personal user information and it creates confusion for my 
customers to understand what information is used, where and when.  
I would like to leverage my GDPR compliance in a way to give a Marketing Transparency signal for my customers
ensuring a better user experience about personal data privacy and more confidence in using all my channels.
