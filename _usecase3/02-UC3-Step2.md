On each of my channels, I have a specific processing around users' personal information and it confuses my customers to understand what information is used, where and when.

I want to leverage my GDPR compliance in a way that gives a marketing transparency signal to my customers by ensuring a better user experience around personal data privacy and a greater trust in using all of my channels.
