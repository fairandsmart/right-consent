## Use modular components

Consent forms are composed of elements of six types: information, processings, preferences, terms and conditions, emails, themes. Each type is associated with a dedicated **library**, allowing for **flexibility** in the construction of consent forms, or for A/B testing.

## Use models lifecycles

The models editor offers various lifecycle tools:
- **Drafts**, of course;
- Version publication: **minor versions** are useful to correct typos, **major versions** are intended for changes which imply the invalidation of previous records, such as adding a section to a terms and conditions model;
- Version control: no iteration is lost, read-only history is available for controls or reverting changes.

## Define processings

## Define preferences

## Define terms and conditions

## Export and import models (Enterprise only)

The Enterprise edition offers models export and import to ease their use or allow interactions with other applications.

## Manage models translations (Enterprise only)

The Enterprise edition allows models translation, whereas the Community version only provides one language (English or French, selected at start) for all models and forms.

## Customize consent forms

Consent forms may be freely styled using CSS-based theme components.

## Manage form layouts (Enterprise only)

## Confirm consents

In order to increase security, Right Consents offers various means of confirmation upon submitting of a consent form: confirmation codes sent by email or SMS, digital signature, audio or video recording...

## Interrogate records

## Give end-users access to their consents

A dedicated **user page** may be enabled in Right Consents Community to allow end-users to **consult and change** their consents and preferences through simple email-based authentication.

This basic user page can be replaced by the organisation's own **customer privacy platform**.

The Enterprise version is shipped with a more developed, fully customizable customer privacy platform.

Receipts contain a link to this page if it is enabled.

## Operate consents

The organisation's **operators** can access any user's history of consents and preferences, as well as the associated receipts and some basic information such as the user's email address.

Operators are allowed to **change** a user's consents and preferences at their request, which produces records and a receipt marked as originating from an operator (instead of the end-user themselves) for **full transparency**.

## Store receipts

A **timestamped PDF receipt** is generated every single time a user's consents or preferences are created or changed. These receipts can be sent directly to the user's email address after submission, or retrieved and forwarded by an operator.

## View usage statistics

The dashboard presents easy-to-read statistics on collected consents and preferences, users count...
