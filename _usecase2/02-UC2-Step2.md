I want to keep trace and a proof that TOS have been accepted and when.   
In the futur of my application, Terms Of Service may be subject of **evolution**, and I will also need to 
managing the segmentation between application version, accepted TOS version and many aspects of my user's privacy experience.  
This could become quickly a pain point and going to a dedicated solution may help me in that task.
