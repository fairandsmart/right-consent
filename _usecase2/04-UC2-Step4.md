Having integrated **Right Consents**, I can also manage other aspects of user privacy like preferences or consents (GDPR) in a single 
and centralized system. I will then be able to use the record database in all my customer relationship management tools to follow  
their choices and increase my marketing strategy transparency.
My customers are also able to manage all their personal information privacy aspects in a unified interface event if collected 
by all my disseminated tools.
