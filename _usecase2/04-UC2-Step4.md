Having integrated **Right Consents**, I can also manage other aspects of usersâ€™ privacy like **preferences or consents** (GDPR) in a single, **centralised system**. I will then be able to use the record database in all my CRM tools to keep track of their choices and increase the transparency of my marketing strategy.

My users are also able to manage all **privacy aspects** of their personal information in a unified event-driven interface if collected by all my disseminated tools.
