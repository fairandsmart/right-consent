## Dashboard

The Right Consents Community backoffice homepage is a basic **dashboard** which should help you visualize how many users are generating consents with your forms and which models are the most used.

## A/B testing

You can take advantage of the **unlimited number of models** (except [information](/docs/model-types)) you can create to implement A/B testing in your application. Use the [interrogation page](/docs/model-queries) to determine the best models in terms of consents number... or positive consents number.
