## User access

To deliver the best experience to the end-users (through even more transparency and control over their data), a dedicated interface can be made available to the end-users to access their choices regarding the organization's processings and preferences and to be able to modify their choices at any time.

To access this dedicated page, the users will need to be authenticated (cf page "User Authentication"). 

{% include gallery %}

### Is it mandatory? 

The access to this dedicated page is, of course, totally configurable for the organization: you can choose to give your users access to this page or not, to choose what they can and cannot see on this page...

TODO

ensure consent can be changed in consentcontext (parameter for context, not for model - it's about the transaction)
receipt has link & QR code to update
end of transaction already allows for consent immediate modification
tell them to get in touch with an operator
activate user page (link in receipt or you can send them the link again)
