## How can I query consents related to one of my models?

Specific model consents can be accessed through the **interrogation page** in the Integration section of the backoffice.

## Interrogation page

To use this page, you simply need to **select one of your [data models](/docs/model-types)** (sorted between processings, preferences and terms and conditions), then **one value** (or several for some kinds of preferences) and execute the query.

A table will display all the **valid records** matching your query, each line consisting of:
  - the user ID
  - the user email (if known)
  - the model's unique key
  - the record's serial
  - the consent/choice value

This table may be **exported in CSV** for further use.

### What about more complex queries?

Complex queries using several models and/or values are supported by the backend but not exposed through the Right Consents Community client.
