If one of your users is looking for a proof of their consent, ask them their **subject ID**. Enter this value in the **search bar** at the top of the backoffice to access the dedicated [operator interface](/docs/user-queries). There, you can open the **history window** of the desired processing: each line contains a button to **download the associated [receipt](/docs/records-receipts)** (in PDF).

If this fails - because they forgot their **subject ID** for instance -, you can always send them a new form to submit their consent again. Be sure to send them a **notification email** so that they receive the receipt as attachment.
